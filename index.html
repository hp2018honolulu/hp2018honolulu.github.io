					<h3>E<sup>3</sup>: Extreme materials, extreme phenomena, extreme environments</h3>
					<p>
					Extreme conditions science is a vibrant mutidisciplinary field in which materials behavior, properties and phenomena are studied for the purpose of 
					exploring and characterizing unique states of matters that are not accessible under ordinary conditions, to simulate processes taking place in inaccessible 
					extreme environments such as deep planetary interiors, or to make new materials with unique properties and prospects of technological applications. Last 
					decade has witnessed both milestone advancement in crystallographic instrumentation for high-pressure studies and improvements in robustness and reliability 
					of experimental methodology and software, as well as ab intio methods for structure solution from both polycrystalline and single-crystal samples. Crystallographic 
					structure determination at pressures far exceeding 10 GPa gradually becomes routine, with a number of recent reports successfully resolving crystallographic details
					of samples at pressures far exceeding 100 GPa. Methods allowing to carry out reliable single-crystal-like analysis of multi-grain data collected on coarse powder 
					samples composed of hundreds of individual crystallites are under active development, and offer new ways to quantitatively characterize development of lattice 
					preferred orientation during sample deformation. New types of X-ray detectors and pressure-controlling devices allow collecting crystallographic data with 
					unprecedented speed and at controlled stress and strain rates, enabling time-resolved experiments. Experimental extreme conditions crystallography is closely 
					coupled with computational mineral physics. Knowledge of crystal structures of high-pressure phases opens doors for first principles calculations that can predict 
					properties (e.g. transport) too difficult or impossible to measure experimentally, and extend beyond pressure and temperature limits accessible to experiments. On 
					the other hand, while there is a considerable progress in predictive power of computational methods, configurational space of all possible atomic arrangements of 
					polymorphic varieties is multi-dimensional, and predicting exactly which one of these forms is realized in nature at given pressure and temperature conditions based 
					solely on calculations still remains a considerable challenge, rendering experiments uniquely necessary. 
					<br>
					The purpose of the 2018 workshop of the International Union of Crystallography (IUCr) Commission on High Pressure is to bring researchers applying tools of the 
					high-pressure crystallography in different disciplines of science, ranging from biology, through condensed matter physics, solid state chemistry, and geophysics, 
					to materials science and nanotechnology to one table, and stimulate discussions about recent developments and discoveries and most exciting future directions.

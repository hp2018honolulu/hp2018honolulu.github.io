					<h3>E<sup>3</sup>: Extreme materials, extreme phenomena, extreme environments</h3>
					<p>
					Extreme-conditions science is a vibrant, multidisciplinary field that characterizes unique states of matter, simulates processes that take place in inaccessible 
					environments such as planetary interiors, and synthesizes new materials with properties that have compelling technological applications. The last decade has seen
					milestones reached in crystallographic instrumentation for high-pressure studies and improvements in the robustness of experimental methodology and software, as 
					well as ab initio techniques. Crystallographic structure determination at pressures up to a megabar has become routine, and several recent reports have even far 
					exceeded that pressure. Furthermore, methods are actively being developed that enable the analysis of multi-grain data collected on samples composed of hundreds 
					of individual crystallites, and that can quantitatively characterize the development of lattice-preferred orientation during sample deformation. Advances in X-ray 
					detector technology and pressure-controlling devices facilitate the collection of crystallographic data with unprecedented speed, and at controlled stress and 
					strain rates, enabling time-resolved experiments. 
					Computational approaches now play an integral role in extreme-conditions crystallography. However, while there has been considerable progress in expanding the 
					predictive power of computational methods, the complex energy landscapes of multicomponent chemical systems make it such that they work best in tandem with 
					physical experiments.  Measurement-based determination of the crystal structures of high-pressure and temperature phases opens the door for first-principles 
					calculations to predict material properties that are too difficult to measure in the lab. These methods can also be used to explore environmental conditions 
					that are inaccessible to experiments. 								
					<br>
					The purpose of the 2018 workshop of the International Union of Crystallography (IUCr) Commission on High Pressure is to bring together researchers who apply these 
					tools of extreme-conditions crystallography to different disciplines of science, including biology, condensed-matter physics, solid-state chemistry, geophysics, 
					materials science, and nanotechnology, and to stimulate discussion about recent developments in their fields and exciting research directions for the future.
